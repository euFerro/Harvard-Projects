sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: With 50 thousand size , sort1 manage to handle sorted50000.txt in 1.0 to 1.2s and reversed50000.txt in about 6.0s
just like bubble sort with omega of n and O of n^2.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Even with size of 50 thousand, sort2 manage to handle sorted50000.txt and reversed50000.txt basically in the same time, 1 to 1.2 seconds.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: I checked that even with the sorted array it took about the same as a reversed one
just like selection sort n^2 (theta).
