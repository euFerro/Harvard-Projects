HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
================================

HTML is a markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It defines the elements and tags that are used to mark up the content, allowing web browsers to interpret and display the page properly. Here's an overview of HTML and its key features:

What is HTML?
-------------

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and is widely supported by all web browsers. HTML uses a set of tags and elements to structure the content and define its semantics. It provides a way to format text, insert images, create links, embed multimedia, and more.

Key Features of HTML:
---------------------

### 1\. Structure and Semantics:

HTML allows you to define the structure of a web page by using elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and more. It provides semantic meaning to the content, making it easier for search engines, screen readers, and other tools to understand and interpret the page.

### 2\. Tags and Elements:

HTML uses tags to define elements within the document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and provide instructions to the browser on how to render the content. Examples of HTML elements include `<h1>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<a>` for links, `<img>` for images, and many more.

### 3\. Attributes:

HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or modify their behavior. Attributes are added within the opening tag of an element and provide values. For example, the `<a>` (anchor) element has the `href` attribute to specify the URL of the link.

### 4\. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):

HTML works seamlessly with CSS, which is used to control the presentation and styling of web pages. CSS allows you to define colors, fonts, layouts, and other visual aspects of the HTML elements, providing a separation between content and presentation.

### 5\. Interactive Features:

HTML supports interactivity through features like forms, input fields, buttons, and multimedia embedding. Forms allow users to input data, which can be processed on the server side. HTML5 introduced new elements like `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<canvas>`, which enable the integration of multimedia content and dynamic graphics.

### 6\. Accessibility:

HTML provides built-in features to enhance web page accessibility. It includes elements for headings, alternative text for images, semantic structure for screen readers, and attributes for improving keyboard navigation. These features ensure that web content is more inclusive and usable for users with disabilities.

### 7\. Extensibility:

HTML is an extensible language. It allows the creation of custom elements and attributes through specifications like Web Components. This extensibility enables the development of reusable and modular components, fostering code reusability and maintainability.

Conclusion:
-----------

HTML is the fundamental building block of web pages, providing structure, semantics, and interactive features. With its tags, elements, and attributes, HTML allows web developers to create well-organized and accessible content. By combining HTML with CSS and other technologies, web pages can be beautifully designed and functionally rich, delivering a rich user experience on the World Wide Web.
